# Tekcit

Tekcit is a movie database to show off Ruby on Rails full MVC capability with Semantic Ui. The project allows a user to search for movies based on Genres, Titles, Theaters and Cities that a movie may be playing in. The user can then buy a ticket and have it saved to their history page or delete past tickets. The database currently utiizes information generated by the refactored [Ffaker](https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker) gem and [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for all component details.
